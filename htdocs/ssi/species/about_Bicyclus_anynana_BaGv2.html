  <p>The squinting bush brown butterfly, <em>Bicyclus anynana</em>, is a member of the remarkably speciose Mycalesine butterflies that are distributed across the Old World tropics [1]. Males have a wingspan of about 35-40 mm, while females are slightly larger (45-49 mm) [2]. Adults are found primarily in woodland habitats across East Africa (from southern Sudan in the north to Swaziland in the south), and are typically observed flying close to the ground where they feed on fallen fruit [2]. The larvae of <em>B. anynana</em> feed on several species of grass. It is a model organism for the study of the development, plasticity and evolution of butterfly wing patterns [2,3,4]. In addition, <em>B. anynana</em> is one of the only insect species to exhibit seasonal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphenism">polyphenism</a>, whereby individuals that develop during the wet season differ in both behaviour and appearance to those that develop during the dry season [1,5]. Wet-season butterflies are smaller, have shorter lifespans, are more active, and show large and conspicuous eyespots on their wings in comparison to dry season individuals [6]. Thus, <em>B. anynana</em> is an important system through which to study the evolution of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity">phenotypic plasticity</a>.</p>
