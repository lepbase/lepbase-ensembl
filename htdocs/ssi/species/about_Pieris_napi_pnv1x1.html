  <p id="about">(From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green-veined_white">Wikipedia</a>). The 
green-veined white (Pieris napi) is a butterfly of the family Pieridae. A circumboreal species widespread 
across Europe and Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, Japan, the Maghreb and North America. It is found 
in meadows, hedgerows and woodland glades but not as often in gardens and parks like its close relatives the 
large and small whites, for which it is often mistaken. Like other "white" butterflies, the sexes differ. The 
female has two spots on each forewing, the male only one. The veins on the wings of the female are usually 
more heavily marked. The underside hindwings are pale yellow with the veins highlighted by black scales giving 
a greenish tint, hence green-veined white. Unlike the large and small whites, it rarely chooses garden 
cabbages to lay its eggs on, preferring wild crucifers. Males emit a sex pheromone that is perceptible to 
humans, citral, the basic flavor-imparting component of lemon peel oil.
