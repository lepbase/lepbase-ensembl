<p id="about">(From Wikipedia) Junonia coenia, known as the common buckeye or buckeye, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. It is found in all parts of the United States except the northwest, and is especially common in the South, the California coast, and throughout Central America. Its habitat is open areas with low vegetation and some bare ground. Its original ancestry has been traced to Africa, which then experiences divergence in Asia.
